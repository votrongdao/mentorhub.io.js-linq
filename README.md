# js-linq
Linq in JavaScript: js-linq brings LINQ-style query syntax to JavaScript, allowing you to perform complex data transformations and queries with ease. This library mimics the LINQ functionality in C#, providing methods like where, select, join, orderBy, and more, enabling powerful data manipulation on arrays and objects.

# Features
Chaining API: Similar to LINQ in C#, you can chain together methods like where, select, orderBy, etc.
Join functionality: Perform inner joins between multiple arrays.
Supports complex queries: Filter, project, and sort data in a declarative style.
Easy to use: Simple and clean syntax that integrates well with your existing JavaScript codebase.
